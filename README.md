# A-frame-physics-test

conclusion is, you can pick up objects, but they wont have gravity applied, or have gravity and not be able to pick up objects. banging my head on a brick wall with this one. it appears that there are certain variations of cdn script links that behave better than others, and i havent got the time or resources to analyze approx  5x 5000 ish lines of mathmatically based physics and rendering code. time to move on to wonderland engine to test if i can have nav links and iframes AND physics and grabbable objects. then perhaps godot to see if it can do the same.

seems meta like this wonderland engine so hoping its user friendly.
